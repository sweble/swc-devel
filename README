== Maven Build Profiles ==

=== sign ===

Sign artifacts

=== quick ===

Makes <code>mvn install</code> run a lot faster.

* Skip tests
* Skip license header checks
* Only generate minimal site

=== build-aggregates ===

Put all libraries in a jar which can then run on its own.
The jar is call <code>*-with-dependencies</code>.

=== build-examples  ===

Generates a maven archetype and an eclipse project for each example project.

'''IMPORTANT:''' Before running maven with this profile enabled make sure 
<code>mvn install -Pbuild-aggregates</code> has been run. The Eclipse project 
generation requires a jar-with-dependencies which has to be generated and 
installed by a previous maven run.

== Build Tasks ==

=== Deploy Example Archetypes ===

If you want to deploy example archetypes export the following variable:

 export DEPLOY_EXAMPLE_ARCHETYPES="-Prelease -Psign"

then

 mvn -Pbuild-examples package

=== Deploy to Different Repository  ===

If you want to deploy to a local repository (for testing/staging), add

 -DaltDeploymentRepository=sonatype-nexus-staging::default::file://[PATH TO LOCAL REPO]"

to <code>mvn &lt;goal></code>

When deploying examples, remeber to also add the above option to
the variable <code>DEPLOY_EXAMPLE_ARCHETYPES</code>.
